## Introduction

This project predicts whether an object is a **rock** or a **mine** (metal cylinder) using the **Sonar dataset**. The Sonar dataset consists of 60 features extracted from sonar signals reflected off rocks and mines in the ocean. The goal is to build a machine learning model that classifies the object based on the features.

This project uses a variety of machine learning algorithms to classify the sonar signals, providing insight into which models perform best for this type of data.

## Key Features

- Classifies objects as either **rock** or **mine** using sonar signals.
- Utilizes various machine learning algorithms such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Random Forest
- Data visualizations to explore and understand the dataset.
- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve for model performance.

## Dataset

The **Sonar dataset** is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and consists of:
- **60 features** representing the strength of sonar signals at different frequencies.
- **1 target variable**: 
  - **R** for rocks
  - **M** for mines

### Data Preprocessing:
- **Feature scaling**: Since the features have different ranges, we standardize them using techniques like **MinMax scaling** or **StandardScaler**.
- **Train-test split**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment for writing and running the code.
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model building and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization and analysis.

## Model Performance

Several machine learning models were explored to classify rocks and mines using sonar data. The following metrics were used to evaluate model performance:
- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correct predictions.
- **Confusion Matrix**: To analyze true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
- **ROC-AUC**: Area under the ROC curve to assess classifier performance.

For example:
- Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of **78%**.
- Random Forest achieved an accuracy of **85%** and showed better performance in terms of the confusion matrix and AUC score.

## Installation and Setup

To run this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rock-vs-mine-prediction.git
   cd rock-vs-mine-prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Use `pip` to install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Run the notebook**:
   Open the `Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.

## How to Use

1. **Preprocess the data**:
   The notebook includes steps for scaling the features and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

2. **Train the model**:
   The notebook contains several models that you can train. You can tune hyperparameters and choose the best model based on evaluation metrics.

3. **Evaluate the model**:
   Various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve are used to determine how well the model performs on the test data.

4. **Predict new sonar data**:
   You can use the trained model to predict whether new sonar signals indicate a rock or a mine by modifying the input features.
